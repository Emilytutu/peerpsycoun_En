        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may have been bothered by anger-hostility in three respects: thoughts, feelings and behavior,including feeling annoyed, slamming objects around you, arguments and uncontrollable outbursts of your temper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hostility may not only have a negative impact on your work life, but can also harm your health in the long run. Therefore, it's necessary for you to adjust and change.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What follows are some daily life tips that you may find helpful:</p>
        <p>(1) Practice how to express your feelings. We sometimes feel dissatisfied with others, at which point neither holding our tongue nor getting angry is a good way to go about it. That 's because either way does not communicate effectively, and cannot let others know exactly where comes your dissatisfaction and what you need. You can say these peacefully, for example, "I'm a little angry that someone is late" and "I hope that someone will be on time in the future". It is also important not to mention too many irrelevant thoughts, so that you can express yoursefl more clearly and efficiently.</p>
        <p>(2) Reflect on your thoughts. What's underneath your annoyance are some negative thoughts. If emotions were a fire, these thoughts would be the fuel for them. Perhaps you sometimes do not have the confidence to achieve what you want, and sometimes you feel that others are not well-intentioned in their actions. These thoughts can make you feel even worse. You should ask yourself, "Are my negative thoughts adding to my unhappiness?"" Is there sufficient evidence supporting them?"" Is there more positive way to understand this situation?" If you find that your original thought is not the only way to intepret what happens, perhaps you want to change it to a more realistic and optimistic thought, so that your mood will improve.</p>
