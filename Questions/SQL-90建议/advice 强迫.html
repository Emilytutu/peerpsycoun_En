        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The obsessive-compulsive factor reflects mainly those thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that we clearly know are unnecessary but cannot be rid of, as well as some behavioral signs of general cognitive impairment.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What follows are some daily life tips that you may find helpful:</p>
        <p>(1) Maybe you can't understand why some bizarre thoughts that you can't even accept come up and wish if only they could go away. But many studies reveal that the problem is not in those thoughts, but in your attitude toward them. Everyone may has such thoughts, but they don't get much worried about them, just letting them happen naturally and occasionally.</p>
        <p>(2) Nevertheless, you may be very preoccupied with these thoughts, and this concern can only reinforce them. You may want your heart to be pure and upright, but in fact our psychological world is very complicated and diverse- desires and resentments are also parts of our human nature. So, there is no need to be too hard on your thoughts. You can never tame your thoughts completely, but you can control your external behavior. While these thoughts have bothered you in the past, it is vital that you keep doing the right things. You can block obsessive thoughts by distracting yourself or exerting external control when they reoccur, for example, by setting an alarm clock to strike you out of thinking, or, if necessary, by doing self-relaxation exercises such as deep breathing.</p>
