        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anxiety generally refers to irritability, fidgeting, nervousness, and the consequent physical symptoms, such as tremors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anxiety is an adaptive emotion, behind which is your positive desire, while at the same time there is worries that your desire might be difficult to fulfill. Therefore, psychologists often suggest that a moderate level of anxiety is most conducive to one's accomplishment of tasks. This is because having no anxiety at all may also be a sign of low motivation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What follows are some daily life tips that you may find helpfulï¼š</p>
        <p>(1) Assign a fixed time to what makes you anxious. In fact, the things that you worry about may not be meaningless, since anything that the you care about needs to be planned. It's often the case that because you don't set aside some time to think them through, they can pop up at any time. So, you can take an hour or half an hour each day as a special time to think about what you have been worrying about, for example, from 6:00 to 6:30 in the evening. Thereafter, do not think about those things outside of this allotted time. If you can't help but recall them again, you have to stop and tell yourself: save these thoughts for your scheduled time.</p>
        <p>(2) Take some deep breaths. Deep breathing is the easiest and most useful way to relax. When you are faced with a stressful situation, do not think about how to escape, but take a few deep breaths and go on with what you want to do.</p>
        <p>(3) Do some exercise. Anxiety is often a state that prevents true relaxation which, in fact, is often associated with genuine excitement and tension. A moderate amount of sports brings a real excitement in your body, which subsequently leads to better relief. However, be careful to monitor your breathing and heart rate, and do not exercise excessively or vigorously.</p>
