        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Depression is characterized by feelings of distress as well as a loss of interest, motivation, and energy. It reflects feelings of frustration and pessimism, plus certain cognitive and somatic symptoms. Besides, frequent thoughts about death and suicide are also included.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What follows are some daily life tips that you may find helpful:</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your emotions, thoughts and physiological state are influenced by each other. Under a low emotional state, your hormone levels will be somewhat affected and therfore be more likely to have negative thoughts than usual. For this reason, in a depressed state, you will probably exaggerate the difficulties and failures and ignore the positive aspects of life. Thoughts in this state are often not consistent with the actual situation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When you suffer depression, you are prone to feel worthless, that your life is full of failures and that your future is dark.This is because human emotions have a natural process of occurring, intensifying and then diminishing, and so does depression.After some time, the down mood will gradually recover and the negative thoughts will fade. Therefore, you should understand that the current state will not last forever and that your negative thoughts are just the temporary products of physiology.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, we suggest that you should not follow the influence of your passive thoughts at present and do some less important stuff like getting some exercise. You don't have to expect yourself to do a good job right away, but you can break it down into smaller steps and do it slowly. The key is not to give up all the efforts you have already made just because of the bad mood. Get yourself busy, and this low mood will also get better sooner.</p>
