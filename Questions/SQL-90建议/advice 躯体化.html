        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The somatization factor score mainly reflects physical discomfort, including discomfort in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and other systems, as well as headaches, back pain, muscle pains, and somatic discomfort such as anxiety. The higher the score, the more somatic discomfort you experience.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What follows are some daily life tips that you may find helpful:</p>
        <p>(1) Have some regular exercise. A healthy lifestyle leads to a good physical and mental conditionï¼Œ as your body and mind can mutually influence each other. Many studies have found that consistent exercise is not only beneficial to physical fitness, but can also effectively regulate bad moods and reduce the risk of mental illness. Be careful not to exercise excessively and vigorously, which may bring discomfort.</p>
        <p>(2) Experience and channel emotions. Reluctance, inability or fear to face and experience your bad emotions is often one of the causes of somatization. You may be someone who demands a lot from yourself and is good at suppressing emotions. However, all kinds of unpleasant emotions and conflicting desires are natural components of your spiritual experience, and they will not cease to exist just because you refuse to feel them. In fact, just because you often ignore them, they need to manifest themselves in other ways, such as physical illness. You just need to confront them, experience them, and find some appropriate way to channel them, for example, talking about them with a close friend.</p>
