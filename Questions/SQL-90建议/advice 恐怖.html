        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What provokes your fears may include traveling, open spaces, crowds, public places and transportation, or even social activities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Psychologists have done many researches on the cause and duration of phobias, and one common finding is that it is the avoidance of the things we fear that reinforces the symptoms, and that confrontation and exposure to our fears is one of the most important ways to treat phobias. This principle is embedded in both systematic desensitization and full immersion therapy used in psychotherapy.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is because human emotions have a natural process of occurring, intensifying and then diminishing, and so does fear. Even if you are in a fearful situation, after a period of time, the emotion of fear will lessen., thus repeated exposure will make the extent of fear triggered by the situation greatly reduce. On the contrary, avoidance deprives the you of the chance to adapt to and learn about the situation, and further aggravates your fear because of lack of understanding. Therefore, it is recommended that you must not give up what you would have done and should have done just because of an undue fear. If you can look directly into your own fear without running away, you will eventually defeat it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, when people encounter a scary situation, their breathing rhythm will become rapid, short and shallow. Therefore, when you are faced with a scary situation, try to adjust your breaths to make it deeper and longer, which can relieve the physical discomfort caused by fear.</p>
