        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Interpersonal sensibility mainly indicate certain discomfort and feelings of inferiority, especially when compared to others. It is usually caused by low self-esteem, apparent uneasiness, self-consciousness, as well as negative expectations in interpersonal communication. A high score in this respect indicates that you have been suffered greatly from interpersonal relationships, in which you would often have low self-esteem, self-centeredness, and negative expectations. </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What follows are some daily life tips that you may find helpful:</p>
        <p>（1）Care about positive feelings in interpersonal interactions. Sensitivity to relationships is often triggered by your desire for intimate and warm relationships, but perhaps you are so busy focusing on what you want this relationship to become that you lose sight of the little pleasures you DO have. Remember that happiness flows from experiencing and cherishing the present moment and valuing the small but real blessings and satisfactions.</p>
        <p>（2）Practice interpersonal skills more often. If you are nervous and have difficulty handling certain social situations, it is often because you have not practiced enough in the past and thus are not comfortable enough with those situations. Interpersonal communication is just like sports- it's something that can be practiced to become proficient, and the skills involved will gradually improve. Participate actively so that you can have more fun.</p>
        <p>（3）Reflect on your thoughts. What's underneath your annoyance are some negative thoughts. If emotions were a fire, these thoughts would be the fuel for them. Perhaps you sometimes do not have the confidence to achieve what you want, and sometimes you feel that others are not well-intentioned in their actions. These thoughts can make you feel even worse. You should ask yourself, "Are my negative thoughts adding to my unhappiness?"" Is there sufficient evidence supporting them?"" Is there more positive way to understand this situation?" If you find that your original thought is not the only way to intepret what happens, perhaps you want to change it to a more realistic and optimistic thought, so that your mood will improve.</p>
